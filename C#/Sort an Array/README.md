# Description

Sort first half in ascending and second half in descending order
Given an array of integers, sort the first half of the array in ascending order and second half in descending order.

# Algorithm

1. Sort the given array.
2. Run a loop up to half the length of the array and print the elements of the sorted array.
3. Run a loop from the last index of the array to the middle of the array and print the elements in reverse order.

# Examples

- Input : arr[] = {5, 2, 4, 7, 9, 3, 1, 6, 8}
  - Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5}

- Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  - Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4}
